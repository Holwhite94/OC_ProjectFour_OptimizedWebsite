The brief - Optimize and existing website

-I was given a fully functioning website and advised to conduct a thorough check to ensure it complies with WCAG guidelines and performs well in terms of SEO.

-I made necessary changes to the website to address WCAG guideline failures, tracking these modifications within an Excel document. I utilized Lighthouse to identify these issues and assess the SEO score, incorporating keywords where necessary to ensure adherence to all accessibility standards.
